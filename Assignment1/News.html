        <li>Australia skipper Pat Cummins confirmed that the team would make changes for the fourth Ashes Test in
            Manchester.

            Australia are going in with an all-out pace attack at Old Trafford for the crucial fourth Test of the Ashes
            series.

            A day ahead of the match, the Australian captain confirmed that Josh Hazlewood would return to the XI at the
            expense of Scott Boland, who has had an ordinary run in the series.

            Todd Murphy also makes way for Cameron Green while Mitchell Marsh retains his place in the XI.</li>

            Saud Shakeel made an unbeaten double century to put Pakistan in the driving seat in the Galle Test at stumps
            on day three. Shakeel completed a double hundred while batting alongside No.11 Abrar Ahmed and remained
            unbeaten on 208 when the last wicket fell. Pakistan took a decisive 149-run lead that could prove to be
            crucial as the Test goes on.

            The Pakistan middle-order batter resumed on 69* and continued the visitors' recovery from 101/5. The pair
            were separated with the score on 278 when Agha Salman fell for 83, but Shakeel carried on for Pakistan.

        <h2>Soccer News</h2>
        <li>All summer long, GOAL's Mark Doyle will be handing out grades for the biggest transfers from around the
            world

            For some football fans, the off-season is the part of the calendar that they look forward to the most, as
            that can only mean one thing: It's time for transfers! Over the next weeks and months, the biggest names
            will be linked with the biggest clubs, with speculation set to go into overdrive.

            We all know that some transfers turn out well for all parties involved, but there are plenty where at least
            one of the clubs, or even the player, are left wondering what might have been had they made a different
            decision while at the negotiating table.</li>
        <li>
            With that prediction proving to be true, the Matildas' best chance of the first half came from a set piece,
            Hayley Raso heading Catley's corner just wide. Ireland, playing at their first ever Women's World Cup, were
            on the back foot for large parts of the game as Australia took control, but they had a few looks on the
            counter, some excellent tracking back from Katrina Gorry stopping a dangerous one after Katie McCabe tried
            to pick out Kyra Carusa.

            But the nerves of a record-breaking crowd in Sydney's Olympic Park, the 75,784 in the stands a new best for
            the Matildas, were eased just a few minutes into the second half as Marissa Sheva was penalised for a foul
            on Raso in the box, with Catley stepping up to confidently convert from 12 yards out.

            The Lionesses have lost just once under the Dutchwoman, who has led teams to three successive finals at major tournaments, winning two of them

It’s late June and England’s Lionesses are talking to the press in the traditional whole-squad media day that takes place before each major tournament. As a handful of journalists huddle around Georgia Stanway, there are a lot of questions about Germany, the midfielder having just won the Bundesliga title in her first season with Bayern Munich.

But when one journalist asks if England head coach Sarina Wiegman might tap into her expertise should the two nations meet in the quarter-finals of the Women's World Cup, Stanway is dismissive.
